A plant condition monitoring service

Allows you to create a profile for your plant, enter in info about species, and specific needs to keep it thriving (hardiness zone? water needs? light needs?)

Link that profile with a wifi enabled sensor which sends temperature, humdity, light, and soil moisture data

Displays these profile cards of plants (date it was bought, last watered, current conditions)

If any condition falls outside the recommended values, render alert

Bonus: use ChatGPT to write messages as the plant
Bonus bonus: send a text with message to owner
Bonus x3: post those messages to Twitter under a plant profile
